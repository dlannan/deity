# deity
A Flow Based Programming rendering system built in 2001

DEiTY is a new approach to programming and development overall. There is no simple comparison, suffice to say, that it will be a revolutionary method for project or application development on any digital medium. Sounds impressive, well, it is. Some of the features intended to become part of DEiTY are just new, and have never before been seen in any system on the pc.
